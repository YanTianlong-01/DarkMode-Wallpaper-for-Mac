## Background
- macOS allows you to select a folder to serve as the wallpaper folder in the settings. Once the update frequency is set, the system will periodically select a random image from the folder to use as the wallpaper.
- macOS has a Dark Mode, which is automatically enabled after sunset.

## Requirement Analysis
- I am looking for a wallpaper app that uses only low-brightness images as wallpapers in Dark Mode, and high-brightness images in Light Mode.
- I found an app called Umbra ([https://replay.software/umbra]), which allows setting different wallpapers for Dark and Light Modes. However, this app only lets you set a single image as the wallpaper, unlike macOS's built-in wallpaper feature, which can randomly select images from a folder.

## Features
- The App will use Folder A as the wallpaper folder in Light Mode and Folder B in Dark Mode.
- Users can set the update frequency, and the App will randomly select an image from the specified folder to use as the wallpaper.
